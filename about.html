      <p class="card-body">
        For those who do not know me, my name is Michael Bateman.  Since youâ€™ve probably been searching around on this website for more information about me, you probably have a little knowledge of who I am.  I live in Toronto and I go to school at Upper Canada College.  I am a trombone player, former hockey player and rower.  I also love all things to do with computers and computer science is a favourite.  My original sport was hockey, but then in 2015, I had a horrible injury which caused me to be injured for a while and be unable to play.  After that, I decided that I would give rowing a try.  For the past 3 years, I have been rowing at Upper Canada College.  If I am not rowing, and not doing school work, you can often find me working on a computer-related project.

      <h4 class="card-title">Achievements</h4>
      <p class="panel-body">
        I have won some very interesting things and most of them when I played hockey.  When I played hockey with the Leaside Flames AA team, I was one of the two MVPs.  My rowing so far has been pretty uneventful.  The most success that I have has so far came at The 143rd Royal Canadian Henley Regatta, finishing 4th.  Other notable finishes include the Sam and Doug Wells regatta where my flyweight 4+ won the 72kg (lightweight) 4+ event. Playing the trombone, bands that I have been in have achieved a gold standard at competitions. This year, I am  part of the Upper Canada College Senior Jazz Band. In Computer Science, I achieved a score of 60/75 on the Junior CCC in 2018(Canadian Computing Contest)

        I am working towards earning my Ontario Secondary School Diploma and my IB Diploma, once I graduate from my high school, Upper Canada College in 2020.
