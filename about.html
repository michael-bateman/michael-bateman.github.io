      <p class="card-body">
        For those who do not know me, my name is Michael Bateman.  Since you’ve probably been searching around on this website for more information about me, you probably have a little knowledge of who I am.  I live in Toronto and I go to school at Upper Canada College.  I am a trombone player, former hockey player and rower.  I also love all things to do with computers and computer science is a favourite.  My original sport was hockey, but then in 2015 I had a horrible injury which caused me to be injured for a while and be unable to play.  After that, I decided that I would give rowing a try.  So for the past 2 years I’ve been rowing at Upper Canada College.  If I am not rowing, and not doing school work, you can often find me trying a computer science project out.

      <p class="panel-body">
        I have won some very interesting things and most of them when I played hockey.  When I played hockey with the Leaside Flames AA team, I was one of the two MVP's.  My rowing so far, has been pretty uneventful.  The most success that I have has so far came at The 143th Royal Canadian Henley Regatta, finishing 4th.  Other notable finishes include the Head of the Genesee Regatta where my flyweight 4+ came 3rd.  I won many music awards as a band.  I won two Ontario Band Association gold medals in grade 7, and a OBA gold medal in grade 8.  I have also won a gold medal in the grade 8, Upper Canada College Concert Band.

      <p class="panel-body">
        I am working towards earning my Ontario Secondary School Diploma and my IB Diploma, once I graduate from my high school, Upper Canada College in 2020.  I am also working to earn my Duke of Ed Bronze award in six months.  In grade 7 at Upper Canada College, I was on the honour roll which means that a student achieves over 80% average.
