<h2>Places I’ve Visited</h2>
<p>I have visited many interesting places around the globe by travelling.  I’ve travelled to all 6 inhabited continents.  Some of my favourite travel destinations are London, England, and Rome, Italy.</p>

<h3>London, England</h3>
<p>I visited London, England in 2012 in time for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.  We went to many great sporting events during the Olympics and stayed 5 days after the Olympics ended.  The reason we decided to stay later was because if we stayed, there would be less line-ups for activities such as the London Eye.  At the end of the trip, the 5 extra days were awesome and during that time we got to do the most of our sightseeing.</p>

<h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
<p>I visited Rome, Italy this past summer and it was a lot of fun.  We visited the colosseum which was really cool.  Yeah that’s all I have to say…</p>
