			I visted London, England in 2012 to watch the Olympics and Paralympics.  During the Olympics, we went to watch many sports including the mens 8+ rowing and the marathon.  Between the Olympic and Paralympics, we did a lot of sightseeing in London and the surrounding area.

			I visited Rome, Italy this past summer.  We spent 10 days in Rome, 4 days in Florence, and 6 days in Venice.  The trip was really fun and one of the highlights of the trip was the Colosseum in Rome.  It was really intresting to see the old buildings in Italy, as there are very few to none in Canada

			In June of 2014, I travelled to Iceland for 10 days with my previous school.  In Iceland, we went whale watching, visited some museums, and went on a fishing boat for a day.  The fishing boat was awesome, as we caught many fish, which some we later ate.  The fish that we caught on the boat that I was on, was sold the next day at the local market.
