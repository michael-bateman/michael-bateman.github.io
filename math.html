<h2>Math</h2>
<p>So this year I am taking enriched math at UCC which is quite different from the standard regular math at UCC.  The main and most obvious difference from standard to enriched math at UCC is that there are harder problems.  One of the other differences is that you are not “taught” the material.  You learn the material through the problem solving book.  Every class we problem solve and the teacher never teaches us the traditional style, on the blackboard.  This problem solving learning makes things a lot more fun.</p>
<h2>My Problems</h2>
<p>As I explained before, we do problems.  As a benefit to my classmates they are able to look at a picture I uploaded of my solution.  The links are down below.</p>
