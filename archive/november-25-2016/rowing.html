<p>So far, I have just completed rowing for 3 years.  During the spring, I row for Upper Canada College, my high school.  During the summer I row for Argonaut Rowing Club and the fall at Hanlan Boat Club.  One of the major highlights of last summer was coming 4th at the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta in the Sr. Men’s Coxed Lightweight 4 with the Argonaut Rowing Club.  Last year, rowing with UCC, it was our novice year, meaning that there was more of a “racing experience” rather than winning medals.  Below are some pictures of me rowing.</p>
