<p>There’s not a lot of information here.  Yeah so you probably won’t want to visit here.  I just decided to make this section of the website so it would make things look cool.  I couldn’t just have a webpage with one sub-page.  I made this page.</p>
<h3>Ensembles</h3>
<p>Last year I was in the Concert Band which was fun.  We went to Chicago for a band performance and won a gold award.  This year I am in the Symphonic Band and am in the Intermediate Jazz band which is also a lot of fun.  We do not have many performances this year and will not have a big trip like we did last year.</p>
