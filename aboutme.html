		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h3>Biography</h3> 
				<p>I am 14 years old and in Grade 9, but am doing Grade 10 and 11 Ontario Ministry of Education curriculum.  During the school week, you can often find me in the practice modules in the music room practicing the trombone or working on schoolwork.  My favourite subjects this year are Math and Computer Science. I am taking a Grade 11 level Computer Science course.  I enjoy both Rowing and Hockey. I played AA hockey for many years until I was forced to stop due to severe injuries.  I currently row for the Argonaut Rowing Club, Hanlan Boat Club and my high school, Upper Canada College.</p>
			<h3>Experience</h3>
				<p>I am an experienced software beta tester, blogger and food tester.  I test prerelease software from Apple, which includes it’s well known software such as iOS 10 and macOS Sierra.  I have also tested iOS 8 and 9, and Yosemite and El Capitan.  I run my own tech blog, which you can visit <a href="http://blog.michaelbateman.ca">here</a>.  I also volunteer at the Linux Foundation to beta test new versions of Linux Ubuntu.  My tech blog achieves an average of about 200 daily views, mostly from Canada, the United States and Australia.  This year, I joined the nutrition committee at my high school, Upper Canada College, which allows me to taste food before it’s released to the school.</p>
			<h3>Acheivements</h3>
				<p>I have won some very intresting things and most of them when I played hockey.  When I played hockey with the Leaside Flames AA team, I was one of the two MVP's.  My rowing so far, has been pretty uneventful.  The most success that I have has so far came at The 143th Royal Canadian Henley Regatta, finishing 4th.  Other noteable finishes include the Head of the Genesee Regatta where my flyweight 4+ came 3rd.  I am working towards acheving the IB diploma, the Ontario Secondary School Diploma and my Duke of Edinburough's award.</p>
