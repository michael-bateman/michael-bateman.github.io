<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am 14 years old, in Grade 9, doing Grade 10 and 11 Ontario Ministry of Education curriculum.  During the week, you can often find me in the practice modules in the music room, practicing the trombone or working on some schoolwork.  My favourite subjects this year is Math and Computer Science.  My Computer Science is my grade 11 course.  It is a lot of fun.  Not to brag, I would say that I am one of the more advanced ones in the class as I am mostly proficient in HTML.  Currently in Computer Science, we just finished our unit on the <a href=http://one.laptop.org>OLPC</a> (One Laptop Per Child) which is a green laptop.  You can find out more about the OLPC by clicking on the words “OLPC.”  My sports are Rowing and Hockey which I enjoy.  I played AA hockey for many years’ until I was forced to stop because I had some pretty severe injuries.  I currently row for the Argonaut Rowing Club, Hanlan Boat Club and my highschool, Upper Canada College.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I am an experienced software beta tester and blogger.  You can visit my technology blog <a href=“http://blog.michaelbateman.ca>here</a>.  Currently, I beta test operating systems for Apple such as iOS 10 and macOS Sierra.  In the past I have beta tested iOS 8 and 9, and OS X Mavericks to Yosemite.</p>
